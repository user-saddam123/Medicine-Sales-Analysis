## Dashboard Overview
Based on the project objective, I have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard report consisting of three pages, each serving a distinct purpose to provide valuable insights from the medicine sales data.

#### 1. Overview Page:
This page offers a high-level view of overall sales, showcasing various aspects such as total sales, revenue, and key performance indicators. It includes visualizations like bar charts and summary cards to present an intuitive and informative snapshot of the sales performance.

#### 2. Customers and Demographics Page:
The second page focuses on customer-related insights and demographic analysis. It displays detailed information about customer segments and demographic distribution. 

#### 3. Trend Analysis Page:
The final page is dedicated to trend analysis, highlighting different trends in sales and revenue over time. It includes line charts, trend lines, and time-series analyses to illustrate sales performance and revenue growth patterns. This page helps stakeholders identify seasonal variations, growth trends, and other temporal insights.
