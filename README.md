## Dashboard Overview
Based on the project objective, I have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard report consisting of three pages, each serving a distinct purpose to provide valuable insights from the medicine sales data.

#### 1. Overview Page:
This page offers a high-level view of overall sales, showcasing various aspects such as total sales, revenue, and key performance indicators. It includes visualizations like bar charts and summary cards to present an intuitive and informative snapshot of the sales performance.

#### 2. Customers and Demographics Page:
The second page focuses on customer-related insights and demographic analysis. It displays detailed information about customer segments and demographic distribution. 

#### 3. Trend Analysis Page:
The final page is dedicated to trend analysis, highlighting different trends in sales and revenue over time. It includes line charts, trend lines, and time-series analyses to illustrate sales performance and revenue growth patterns. This page helps stakeholders identify seasonal variations, growth trends, and other temporal insights.

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the overall sales performance, designed to give stakeholders a clear and detailed understanding of key metrics and trends. The page is structured as follows:

#### Top KPIs Section:
At the top of the page, five key performance indicators (KPIs) are displayed. These KPIs are dynamically filtered based on the selected month, providing a quick snapshot of the following metrics:

 * **Quantity Sold**: Comparison between the current month and the previous month, along with the growth percentage.
 * **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Monthly comparison and growth percentage.
 * **Revenue:** Monthly comparison and growth percentage.
 * **Profit:** Monthly comparison and growth percentage.

These KPIs help in monitoring monthly performance and identifying trends at a glance.

#### Top and Bottom Drugs Bar Chart:
Below the KPIs, a bar chart is presented to display the top and bottom performing drugs. The drugs can be viewed based on various metrics, such as:
 * Transactions: Number of transactions for each drug.
 * Profit: Profit generated by each drug.
 * Revenue: Revenue generated by each drug.
 * Units Sold: Number of units sold for each drug.

This chart helps in identifying which drugs are performing well and which ones need attention.

#### Top and Bottom Customers Bar Chart:
Similar to the drugs chart, there is a bar chart for customers, showing the top and bottom customers based on:
 * Transactions: Number of transactions made by each customer.
 * Profit: Profit generated from each customer.
 * Revenue: Revenue generated from each customer.
 * Units Sold: Number of units sold to each customer.

This analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and identifying key customer segments.
